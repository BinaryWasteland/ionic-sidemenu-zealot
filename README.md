# An Ionic Sidemenu Alternative
Starting an Ionic project using ```ionic start myApp sidemenu```? Notice how the project layout/file structure is a swirling mass of entropy? Fork this project and see that slight changes to the way that Ionic Sidemenu is structured can be a wonderful thing! Comments and feedback welcome. I am working on improving this further but it is a good start.

Need to determine how/if its possible to add it to the ```ionic start myApp bw-sidemenu``` instead of ```ionic start myApp sidemenu```
